# openvibe-broadcast

Version 2.x of OpenVibe supports TCP/IP communicaton protocol, so a scenario can be created that streams the data to the internet or local net and a client can receive it

This project implements a simple test scenario (signal_broadcast.mxs) that works as server and a python code (test_broadcast.py) that works as client, listening to the streamed data in online real-time and showing it in raw form and fft processed

Communication parameters should be filled in the configFile.txt
